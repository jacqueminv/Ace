There are a lot of stuff to learn about Core Animation. This project
has been my first attempt to dig into this. It might evolve in
the future or I might create other projects to go further in my
apprenticeship.

Navigate through the commits to see how the application evolved:

* `2b80795`: drawing of central heart and upper left artifact
* `6073aef`: first use of transforms to rotate the context to draw the
reversed heart and card number at lower right corner
* `5aec097`: animation of the central heart using iOS4 block api
* `aa36386`: `CABasicAnimation` usage to start/stop the animation
* `4f22dc1`: usage of a transition to add a flip effect (i.e. what was
 at first intended in the previous commit)
